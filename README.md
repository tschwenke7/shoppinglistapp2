# Shopping List App 2
The all in one Android app for planning your weekly meals and grocery shopping, this is more than just a shopping list! Build a recipe book and search your recipe collection, add recipes to a meal plan, and quickly add all ingredients needed for your plan straight to the shopping list. Duplicate items will have their quantities automatically merged so you can easily found out how much you need. This app will streamline your meal planning experience!

The app has three main tabs:
- Shopping List - maintains a list of what you need from the shop, and allows you to cross off items as you find them.
- Recipes - your recipe book of all the recipes you use. Add recipes here as you use/plan to use them, so you can search for and reuse them in future meal plans. You can easily add all ingredients from a recipe to your shopping list.
- Meal plan - use this to plan out your next series of meals. You can see what ingredients this plan will need, and easily add them all straight to your shopping list.

You can swap between tabs by swiping sideways or by using the toolbar at the bottom of your screen.

## Installation
To install Shopping List App 2 on your Android device, download the file "ShoppingListApp2.apk" in the root directory of this repo to your device and open it (see here for guide: https://www.nextpit.com/android-for-beginners-what-is-an-apk-file#howtofromandroid).

## Using the shopping list tab
### Adding items
The shopping list shows you a list of what you need at the shops. You can add items by typing them into the box at the top. You should always write the quantity of the item you want before its name, if applicable.

You can add multiple at a time if each item is written on a new line, making it easy to paste in from a note or text message.

### Crossing off/editing items
To cross off an item as you find it in store, simply tap it. The item will be struck off and moved to the end of the list. If you end up wanting it back, simply find it at the end and tap again to uncross it and move it back to the top.

To permanently remove items from the list, tap the options icon in the top right and select either "Delete crossed off items" or "Delete ALL items".

You can edit an item's name by pressing and holding it (NOTE: some naming conventions will be applied). If it ends up now having the same name as another item on the list, the two will be merged and their qunatities combined.

### Sharing a shopping list
To send a shopping list to someone, you can select the options menu in the top right and choose "Copy to clipboard". This will copy all the items in the list with each on a new line. You can then paste it, for example into a messaging app to send to someone else. They could then copy that into the input field of their shopping list on their own device to add them all in, or simply read from it if they don't have the app.

## Using the Recipe Book tab
This tab is designed to be a record of all the recipes you use. Add recipes here as you use/plan to use them, so you can search for and reuse them in future meal plans. You will be able to see a list of all your recipes, with some basic details about each. Clicking a recipe will take you to the view/edit page, where you can see ingredients and more details.

### Adding a new recipe
To add a new recipe, click the "+" icon in the top right. You can then either create one from scratch, or prefill recipe details by copying in the URL of a recipe from a supported website. Make sure you have an internet connection on your device for this to work. This converter isn't perfect due to inconsistencies in website design, so it's recommended that you check the prefilled details before saving (e.g. recipe specifies 'water' as an ingredient, which you don't need to add to your shopping list ever).
Currently supported websites include:

- www.recipetineats.com
- More websites coming soon...

Whether prefilling or from scratch, you will now be directed to the recipe viewer/editor page.

### Using the recipe editor page
You can toggle between view and edit mode using the pen (edit) and tick (save) icons in the top right corner. Each recipe has a name, list of ingredients, prep time, cook time, number of serves, two "ratings" (handy for recording two different people's opinions of each dish), recipe website link, list of custom tags (e.g. "main", "italian" -for searching by) and some notes. All fields are optional (except for recipe name).

#### Adding all ingredients to list
While viewing the recipe, you can click the "add to list" icon in the top action bar. All ingredients listed on this recipe will be added to the shopping list. You can optionally tap the ingredients you already have to cross them off first before choosing this option, and they won't be added.

### Searching for recipes
Typing in the search bar will filter your recipes to those with matching names. You can also click "Advanced search" for more options, including:

- Search by
  - Recipe name (default)
  - Ingredient/s - searches for recipes containing one or more ingredients, separated by commas.
  - Tags - searches for recipes with one or more tags, separated by commas.
- Order by
  - Recipe name (alphabetical) (default)
  - Prep time
  - Total time (prep + cook)
  - Person 1's rating
  - Person 2's rating
  - Combined rating
  
Once you've found the recipe you want, tap to view it.

### Deleting a recipe
To delete a recipe, press and hold it in the recipe list, which will highlight the recipe. A delete icon will become visible in the top right corner. You can select multiple recipes for batch deletion.

## Using the Meal Plan tab
The meal plan tab is designed to help you plan out what you will do for a series of meals, e.g. dinners for the next week. 

### Creating a meal plan
You can add meal slots using the "Add meal" button. Each slot can be named by tapping the title to edit it, then click the confirm icon to save the change. Examples slot titles could be "Monday" or "Tuesday lunch".

Each slot may contain a recipe (from your recipe book) and/or a text note.  To add a recipe or note, click the "Recipe" or "Notes" buttons next to the "+" icon in the corresponding meal slot.

#### Note
Adding a note will simply give you a text field to write in. Make sure to click the tick icon to save what you write once you're done. To delete a note, tap it, then tap the bin icon which appears at its end. You can use this to provide an extra detail about a planned recipe for your reference (e.g. "Save leftovers for Thursday,"  or "Parents coming over for dinner"), or use it in place of a recipe (e.g. "Buy takeaway").

#### Recipe
Clicking add recipe will navigate you to the recipes tab, where you can search for recipes. Once you tap a recipe, you will be returned to the meal plan tab and that recipe will be added to the meal plan slot

### Meal plan ingredients
A combined list of ingredients used by all of the recipes you've selected in your meal plan will be automatically generated below. You can cross off items you already have by tapping on them, just like in the shopping list. Once your meal plan is complete, review this list, the click the "add to list" icon next to the "Ingredients Needed" heading to add all remaining items to your shopping list.
