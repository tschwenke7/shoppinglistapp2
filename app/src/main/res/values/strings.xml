        \n\nTIPS
    </string>
    <string name="general_new_recipe_hints">\n\n• Try to use generic ingredient names, e.g. \"coriander\" instead of \"roughly chopped fresh coriander.\" Consistent naming allows ingredients to have their quantities combined when added to your shopping list from different recipes, and makes it easier to search recipes by ingredients.</string>
    <string name="recipe_prefill_hints_general">\n\n• Delete any ingredients you wouldn\'t add to a shopping list, e.g. \"salt and pepper\".
        \n\n• Some ingredients may have had a substitute or alternative name listed. Edit these ingredients to include only the one you will use.</string>
    <string name="recipe_prefill_hints_recipe_tin_eats">
        \n\n• Check for multiple ingredients in one line, and add a separate ingredient for each instead.
        \n\n• Check for ingredients with a range of quantities, (e.g. \"13-16\") and edit them to choose one.
        \n\n• Ingredient names beginning with \"[EDIT_ME]\" were unable to be understood. Please edit and simplify them.
    </string>
    <string name="recipe_prefill_hints_hello_fresh">\n\n• Quantities of HelloFresh recipes often tend to be in "packets" or similar ambiguous units. These will be counted as part of the ingredient\'s name, so you might want to try and replace these with a weight/volume measurement so they can be consistent with other recipes.
